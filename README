The KinectOnOpenNI project's aim is to create a simplified C# wrapper for uisng a Kinect with openNI
The user of the wrapper only has to create a manager and subscribe to events to grab gestures or movements.

At this time the following functions are supported:

- Swap gestures (Left, Right, Up, Down)
- Still Gesture
- Push Gesture

- Depth Image
- RGB Image

- LED Control
- Motor Control

As pre-requirements the OpenNI drivers for the kinect must be installed.
The motor driver must be replaced with the one from the OpenKinect project (part of the repository).
The last one is not mandetory, but if not installed the motor and the LED cannot be controlled.
